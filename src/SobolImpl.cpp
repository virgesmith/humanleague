/* Generation of Sobol sequences in up to 1111 dimensions, based on the
   algorithms described in:
        P. Bratley and B. L. Fox, Algorithm 659, ACM Trans.
	Math. Soft. 14 (1), 88-100 (1988),
   as modified by:
        S. Joe and F. Y. Kuo, ACM Trans. Math. Soft 29 (1), 49-57 (2003).

   Note that the code below was written without even looking at the
   Fortran code from the TOMS paper, which is only semi-free (being
   under the restrictive ACM copyright terms).  Then I went to the
   Fortran code and took out the table of primitive polynomials and
   starting direction #'s ... since this is just a table of numbers
   generated by a deterministic algorithm, it is not copyrightable.
   (Obviously, the format of these tables then necessitated some
   slight modifications to the code.)

   For the test integral of Joe and Kuo (see the main() program
   below), I get exactly the same results for integrals up to 1111
   dimensions compared to the table of published numbers (to the 5
   published significant digits).

   This is not to say that the authors above should not be credited for
   their clear description of the algorithm (and their tabulation of
   the critical numbers).  Please cite them.  Just that I needed
   a free/open-source implementation. */
