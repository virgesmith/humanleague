const char* flatten_docstr = R"docstr(
    Converts an n-dimensional array of counts into an n-column table with a row for each unit

    Args:

const char* prob2IntFreq_docstr = R"docstr(
    Computes the closest integer frequencies given fractional counts and a total population. 

    Args:

        frac: The fractional counts (must be a 1-d array).

        pop: The total population

    Returns:

        A dictionary containing the frequencies and the RMS error
)docstr";

const char* integerise_docstr = R"docstr(
    Tries to construct and integer multidimensional array that has identical marginal sums to the fractional input array (which of course must have 
    integer marginal sums). The algorithm may not always find a solution and will return an approximate array in this case.

    Args:

        pop: The fractional population.

    Returns:

        A dictionary containing The integral population, the RMS error, and a boolean indicating whether the population matches the marginal sums.

const char* sobolSequence_docstr = R"docstr(
    Returns a Sobol' sequence given of supplied dimension and length, optionally skipping values.

        length: The length of the returned sequence

        skips: The number of values to skip. NB the actual number skipped will be the largest power of 2 smaller than the supplied value.
